# SCGame

We're starting off with just a player and blank space, let's see what it turns into by the end of the school year!

# Contribution

Add something unique to the game!  

The idea is that we'll all add things to the game, so please don't make like 90% of the game yourself!  
It's fine if it ends up a mess, it's more fun that way!

## Ideas

- camera movement
- an enemy?
- random bullets to dodge?
- something to collect
- health maybe?
- a wall to walk into?

really, anything you want to add to the game!
