Add something unique to the game!
We're starting off with just a player and blank space, let's see what it turns into by the end of the school year!

# Contribution Guidelines

The idea is that we'll all add things to the game, so please don't make like 90% of the game yourself!
It's fine if it ends up a mess, it's more fun that way!
